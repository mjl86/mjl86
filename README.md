ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mjl86
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in pursuing a career in software development.
ðŸŒ± I've just completed a MSc in Computer Science and I am actively job searching for my next exciting new role. I began my MSc with very little coding or computer science 
background which was challenging. I am amazed with what I have accomplished in those short 16 months.
I am continuing to practice and continuley improve my coding skills by completeing challenges on HackerRank and also revisting projects I completed at the beginning of my MSc to 
see how I would complete them 16 months later.
